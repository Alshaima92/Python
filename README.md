Here's a summary of what I have learned in the Python module lecture today on "Python Syntax and Data Types":

Basic Syntax:
------------------
•	Indentation: Python defines code blocks using indentation (4 spaces).

•	Comments: Use # for single-line comments and ''' or """ for multi-line comments.

Data Types:
---------------
Python includes several built-in data types:

1-	Numeric Types:

•	int: Integer values (e.g., 1, 2, 3)

•	float: Floating-point values (e.g., 1.0, 2.5, 3.14)

•	complex: Complex numbers (e.g., 1 + 2j, 3 - 4j)

- Arithmetic Operations:

•	Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulus (%), Exponentiation (**), Floor Division (//)

2-	Text Type:

•	str: Strings, sequences of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.

- String Operations:

•	Concatenation (+), Repetition (*), Membership Test (in), String Formatting (format ( ))

3-	Boolean Type:

•	bool: Represents truth values True and False.

4-	Sequence Types:

•	list: Ordered and changeable collection of items, defined with square brackets ([ ]).

•	tuple: Ordered and unchangeable collection of items, defined with parentheses (( )).

•	range: Sequence of numbers, created using the range () function.


Mutable vs. Immutable:

•	Mutable: Lists

•	Immutable: Tuples, ranges, strings.

5-	Mapping Type:

•	dict: Collection of key-value pairs, defined with curly brackets ({}).

6-	Set Type:

•	set: Unordered collection of unique items, defined with curly brackets ({}).

7-	None Type:

•	None: Represents the absence of a value. It’s a unique data type with only one value: ‘None’.



Summary:
--------
We have covered the basic syntax of Python and introduced common data types:

1- Numeric Types: int, float, complex.

2- Text Type: str.

3- Boolean Type: bool.

4- Sequence Types: list, tuple, range.

5- Mapping Type: dict.

6- Set Types: set.

7- None Type: None.

These basic data types and syntax rules are foundational for Python programming.
